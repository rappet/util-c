Util headers and source files for ANSI C

This repository holds some ANSI-C header and source files I need for everyday C programming.
It should be no problem to use them whith C++.

For documentation read the comments in the header files.

## ansicodes.h
ansicodes.h holds some definitions for ANSI-Terminal codes. (bold, color, etc.)
